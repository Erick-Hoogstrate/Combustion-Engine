%% EFFICIENCY (via work and LHV)

% Work 
p_V_array = [V(:,1) p(:,1)];
p_V_array(p_V_array(:, 2) > Pamb, :) = [];

% The work is calculated via the area under the graph, which represents 2 cyles
% Therefore the standard outcome will be in [(k)J/2 cycles]

total_work = polyarea(V,p);
total_work = total_work(1);
negative_work = polyarea(p_V_array(:,1),p_V_array(:,2));

work = total_work - 2*negative_work; % [J]

Energy_out = work/1000; % [kJ/2 cycles]

% LHV 

% This calculation is standard done per cycle, since mf is [kg/cycle]
% Therefore you divide by two to make it [kg/2 cycles]

Energy_in = (Q_LHV*mf)/2; % [kJ/2 cycles]

Efficiency_fuel = Energy_out/Energy_in
